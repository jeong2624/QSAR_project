## Project name : QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) model for the relationship between PTP1B Inhibitor and IC50 value

#### Project time : 2021.11.09 - 2021.12.17

#### Description :
* The project was conducted as part of "Advanced chemoinformatics" class in the Department of Bioinformatics at Soongsil University, Korea.
* The purpose of this project is to build linear regression model by using "pyqsar" module in python
* According to this project, I want to create a model that represents the relationship between the PTP-1B inhibitor and the IC50 value.
* We obtained the data from the reference below, and to convert it into an SDF file format, we utilized the PubChem database by using the SID number.
* For building QSAR model, we used PaDEL to generate descriptor.
  
#### Software & Package version
* Python 3.9.10
* PaDEL 2.21
* [pyqsar](https://github.com/crong-k/pyqsar_tutorial)
* rdkit 2021.09.4
